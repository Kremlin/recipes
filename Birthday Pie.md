My mother started making this for my birthday when I was about 7-8 & we just call it "Birthday Pie". It's fairly easy & you can cheat a little by using a store-bought crust if you want.

### The Filling
1 pkg (4 oz) Semi-sweet chocolate
1/3 C milk
2 Tbs sugar
1 pkg (3 oz) cream cheese (softened)
3 1/2 C Cool Whip
8" Graham cracker crust

### The Crust

1 1/2 C Graham crackers (18 crushed)
1/4 C Sugar
1/2 C Butter (melted)

### Prepare the crust

Mix the ingredients well, press into an 8" pie pan

### Make the filling

* Heat chocolate and 2 T of the milk in microwave, check every 1-2 minutes, stirring until melted
* Beat sugar into cream cheese
* Add remaining milk and chocolate to cheese/sugar mixture
* Fold Cool whip, blending until smooth
* Spoon into crust
* Freeze about 4 hours
