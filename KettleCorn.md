## Kettle Corn

1/4 C Peanut oil
1/4 C Sugar
1/2 C Popcorn kernels

* In a large pot with a lid, put oil and 3 popcorn kernels. Place on stovetop with the burner set to medium-high.
* When all three kernels have popped, put sugar and remaining popcorn into pot.
* Keep the pot moving, shaking back and forth (keeping pot on burner)
* When popping slows to 1 pop every 3ish seconds, remove from heat and pour popcorn into large bowl
* Salt to taste, mixing the kettle corn to distribute the salt

Version 2

If you have one of those Whilrley-Pop poppers the recepie is:

3 Tbsp Oil
3 Tbsp Sugar
1/3 C popcorn kernels

* Heat oil/3 kernels in popper
* When 3 kernels have popped, add remaining popcorn and sugar
* Crank popper until popping slows to 1 kernel every 3ish seconds
* Evacuate to bowl, salt

Note - I just started using version 1 and like it a lot better. Cleanup is easier and with the sugar, the crank/gears on the Whirley-Pop gets worked pretty hard.
