## Dutch Baby

### Dry Ingredients

* 67g Flour
* 28g sugar
* 2g salt

### Wet Ingredients

* 2 eggs 
* 4oz milk

### Misc

* 1/2 stick butter


Combine dry ingredients, mix well. Separately mix the wet.

* Preheat oven to 400F - put a cast-iron skillet in the oven while it is pre-heating.
* When the oven reaches 400F, put butter in the skillet to melt.
* Once the butter has melted, remove skillet from oven
* Pour the wet mix into the dry and combine - do *not* overmix, lumps are good. You want to *just* get things wet, getting rid of the biggest clumps. Pour into skillet.
* Put skillet back into oven for 25 minutes.

Serving suggestions: Sprinkle with lemon juice / powdered sugar or (since this is so similar to a pankcake) maple syrup
